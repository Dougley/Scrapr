# Scrapr

Scrapr is an easy way to fetch Discord messages from someone, provided you have a bot with access to the channel

## Prerequisites 
Node 9 or higher installed and added to PATH

## Usage
Clone the repo to a directory of your choice and install modules using `npm i`.   
After that, run the program with the following syntax:
```
node ./index.js CHANNEL_ID USER_ID DISCORD_TOKEN
```
The token used should idealy be a bot token, **using user tokens is not supported and might get you banned from Discord.**
